**The purpose of this guide is to provide suggestions and standards for authoring MOC instructions**.

_The following are standard practice_:

1. Each step should be numbered 1. and not 1,2,3,4 etc. as Markdown will interpret and automatically update each number. 

	>At this time, markdown files are auto-incremented if a 1\. and enter is pressed. Shift+enter, avoids this. 
	
1. While indenting entries, your indentation should be 4 spaces. 
	> 1. If your tab does not default to 4 spaces, in the **editor**, to the right of *Preview Changes*, click **Spaces**. 
	> 1. Select **Tabs** and then the number **4**. 
	
1. Code entries should either have a \` for single entries or \`\`\` for multi-line code entries. 

    >Examples as follows:
    > `ipconfig` (an opening \`the command and then a closing \`)
    > 
    > ```
    > cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16
    > OSPPREARM
    > ```
    > The fence code block consists of \``` the code and then \``` to close the statement. 
  
1. Any entry between a step, should be indented.  

    Examples of entries would be code blocks, block quotes (>), images.  This is commonly referred to as keeping things "in-line".  If they are not properly indented, the numbering will break. 
    
_The following are aesthetic suggestions_:

1. Exercises should have a header one next to them (header 1 = #). 
1. Tasks should have a header two next to them (header 2 = ##). 
1. Each initial log-in (if required) to a virtual machine, should have log-in instructions. 
1. Where possible, bolding is encouraged by adding ** to each side of the item that needs bolded.
