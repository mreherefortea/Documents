The purpose of this guide is provide suggestions and standards for authoring instructions. 

The following are standard practice:

1. Each step should be numbered 1. and not 1,2,3,4 etc. as Markdown will interpret and automatically update each number. 
1. While indenting entries, your indentation should be 4 spaces.  
1. Code entries should either have a ` for single entries or ``` for multi-line code entries. 

    >Examples as follows:
    > `ipconfig` (an opening `the command and then a closing `)
    > ```
    > cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16
    > OSPPREARM
    > ```
